# Feature Specification: Retry Logic

**Feature Branch**: `003-retry-logic`
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "retry logic"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Implement Trace-Based Retry Decision Function (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I want to implement a `should_retry(trace_id)` function that analyzes trace data to determine whether a failed operation should be retried, so that the system can make intelligent decisions about retrying operations based on error types.

**Why this priority**: This function enables the system to distinguish between permanent and transient failures, allowing for automatic recovery from temporary issues while failing fast on errors that won't be resolved by retries.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating traces with different error types and verifying the function returns the expected decision.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a trace with a span containing a validation error, **When** the should_retry function is called with that trace_id, **Then** it returns an ABORT decision.
2. **Given** a trace with a span containing a connection error, **When** the should_retry function is called with that trace_id, **Then** it returns a RETRY decision with a wait time.
3. **Given** a trace with a span containing an unknown error type, **When** the should_retry function is called with that trace_id, **Then** it returns a WAIT decision.
4. **Given** a trace with a span containing error.retriable=true attribute, **When** the should_retry function is called with that trace_id, **Then** it returns a RETRY decision regardless of the error type.

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when no error spans are found in the trace? Return a decision indicating no retry is needed.
- What happens when multiple error spans exist in a trace? The function should analyze all error spans but prioritize the most severe error (permanent errors take precedence).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST implement a should_retry(trace_id) function that analyzes OpenTelemetry trace data.
- **FR-002**: Function MUST query trace data to find spans with status=ERROR.
- **FR-003**: Function MUST extract error.type and error.retriable attributes from error spans.
- **FR-004**: Function MUST return a decision object with fields for: decision (RETRY, ABORT, or WAIT), reason, wait_seconds, trace_id, and span_id.
- **FR-005**: Function MUST classify ValidationError, AuthenticationError, NotFoundError, and AuthorizationError as permanent errors resulting in ABORT decisions.
- **FR-006**: Function MUST classify ConnectionError, TimeoutError, ServiceUnavailableError, and RateLimitError as transient errors resulting in RETRY decisions.
- **FR-007**: Function MUST handle unknown error types by returning a WAIT decision.
- **FR-008**: Function MUST set wait_seconds to 5 for transient errors by default.
- **FR-009**: Function MUST prioritize the error.retriable attribute when present to simplify decision-making.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **RetryDecision**: Simple decision object containing: decision type (RETRY/ABORT/WAIT), reason explanation, wait_seconds (if applicable), trace_id, and span_id.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Function correctly queries OpenTelemetry traces and extracts error information.
- **SC-002**: Function correctly identifies permanent vs transient errors based on error type.
- **SC-003**: Function returns structured decision object with all required fields.
- **SC-004**: Function respects the error.retriable attribute when present in spans.
