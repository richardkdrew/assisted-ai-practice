# Feature Specification: File-Based Trace Storage and Query

**Feature Branch**: `002-find-analyse-traces`
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "find analyse traces"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Store and Retrieve Complete Traces (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I want to store completed spans in a file-based storage and retrieve all spans associated with a specific trace ID, so I can analyze the complete trace even after the request has completed.

**Why this priority**: Storing and retrieving traces by ID is the foundation for any trace analysis. Without this capability, we cannot examine traces after they've been processed.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating traces, retrieving them by trace ID, and verifying all spans are returned with correct relationships and attributes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application has generated traces with multiple spans, **When** I query for a specific trace ID, **Then** I should receive all spans that belong to that trace with complete details.
2. **Given** the trace storage contains thousands of spans, **When** I query for a specific trace ID, **Then** I should quickly receive only the spans relevant to that trace ID.

### User Story 2 - Filter Traces by Time and Error Status (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I want to query traces based on time range and error status, so I can find recent errors for troubleshooting without searching through all traces.

**Why this priority**: Finding recent failures is critical for resolving issues quickly. Time-based filtering narrows the focus to relevant traces during incident investigation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating traces with various timestamps and statuses, then querying for recent errors and verifying the results match the expected time range and error status.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the trace storage contains spans from various time periods with different statuses, **When** I query for error spans within the last hour, **Then** I should receive only error spans that occurred within that time range.
2. **Given** the trace storage contains error spans, **When** I specify a time range for my query, **Then** the results should only include spans within that time range.

---

### User Story 3 - Filter Traces by Attributes (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I want to search for traces based on specific attributes (like error.type or custom attributes), so I can find traces related to specific conditions or errors.

**Why this priority**: Attribute-based filtering enables targeted analysis of specific error types or conditions, which helps identify patterns in similar issues.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating spans with various attributes, then querying based on those attributes and verifying the results contain only spans with matching attribute values.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the trace storage contains spans with various error types, **When** I query for spans with a specific error.type value, **Then** I should receive only spans that match that error type.
2. **Given** the trace storage contains spans with custom attributes, **When** I query for spans with a specific attribute value, **Then** I should receive only spans that match that attribute criteria.

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when querying for a trace ID that doesn't exist? The system should return an empty result set with a clear indication that no matching spans were found.
- How does the system handle very large trace files? The system should implement efficient loading and indexing to maintain performance with large trace volumes.
- What if the trace storage file is corrupted? The system should provide error handling and recovery mechanisms to prevent application failures.
- How does the system handle traces with incomplete span information? The system should store and return available span data, with clear indication of any missing information.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST implement a custom OpenTelemetry SpanProcessor that stores spans to a file
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a query function to retrieve all spans for a given trace ID
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement a function to retrieve recent error spans within a specified time range
- **FR-004**: System MUST support filtering spans by any attribute including error.type
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain a configurable limit of spans (default 1000) to prevent unlimited growth
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve all span data including context, name, status, attributes, and timestamps
- **FR-007**: Query functions MUST return span data in a format that preserves the full span information
- **FR-008**: System MUST support querying spans by multiple criteria simultaneously (e.g., time range AND error status)
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure thread-safety for concurrent span processing and querying
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle file I/O errors gracefully without crashing the application

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **SpanProcessor**: Custom implementation of OpenTelemetry SpanProcessor that writes spans to file and maintains in-memory index
- **Span**: OpenTelemetry span object with trace context, span ID, name, status, attributes, and timestamps
- **SpanStore**: In-memory data structure for efficient querying of spans
- **Query**: A collection of filter criteria to search for spans (trace ID, time range, attributes)
- **TraceFile**: File-based storage format for persisting spans across application restarts

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: System can retrieve traces by trace_id in under 100ms for 95% of queries
- **SC-002**: System can store and query at least 10,000 spans without significant performance degradation
- **SC-003**: Queries filtered by time range return accurate results for 100% of test cases
- **SC-004**: Attribute-based queries (including error.type) return correct spans for 100% of test cases
- **SC-005**: Memory usage remains under 256MB even with maximum (1000) spans stored
- **SC-006**: File-based storage successfully persists spans across application restarts with 100% data integrity
