# User Story: Advanced Resource Reservation System

## Target Personas

### Primary Personas
- **Event Organizers**: Community members who plan workshops, classes, and group events
- **Workshop Leaders**: Instructors who need dedicated space and equipment for recurring sessions
- **Power Users**: Members who work on multi-day projects requiring consistent access to specific tools

### Secondary Personas
- **Community Admins**: Staff who manage resource allocation and handle booking conflicts
- **Casual Members**: Occasional users who want to check availability before visiting

## User Needs

### Core Need Statement
"As a workshop leader, I need to book the community workshop space 2 weeks in advance so that I can plan my class schedule and ensure the space is available when my students arrive."

### Additional User Needs
- "As an event organizer, I need to see what times are already booked so I can find an available slot for my community gathering."
- "As a power user, I need to reserve the laser cutter for my week-long project so I don't have to worry about it being unavailable mid-project."
- "As a community admin, I need to override bookings when necessary for special events or maintenance."
- "As a member, I want to join a waitlist if my preferred time is booked so I can be notified if it becomes available."

## User Journey

### Happy Path: Successful Reservation
1. **Browse Calendar**: User navigates to resource page and views availability calendar
2. **Select Time Slot**: User clicks on desired date/time to open booking form
3. **Request Reservation**: User fills in purpose, duration, and special requirements
4. **Receive Confirmation**: System checks for conflicts, creates reservation, sends email confirmation
5. **Check-in Day-of**: User arrives and checks in using existing check-in system

### Alternative Path: Conflict Encountered
1. **Browse Calendar**: User views calendar and sees some slots already booked
2. **Attempt Booking**: User selects a time that conflicts with existing reservation
3. **See Alternatives**: System displays nearby available time slots
4. **Choose Alternative**: User selects an alternative or joins waitlist
5. **Receive Confirmation**: System confirms new time or waitlist position

### Error Path: No-Show Scenario
1. **Make Reservation**: User books resource for specific date/time
2. **Miss Check-in**: User doesn't check in within 30 minutes of start time
3. **Auto-Cancellation**: System automatically releases reservation
4. **Waitlist Notification**: Next person on waitlist is notified of availability
