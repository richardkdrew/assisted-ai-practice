## Design Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Credit Balance Visualization
**Choice:** Display both numeric value AND progress bar

**Rationale:**
- Numeric value provides exact credit amount
- Progress bar offers quick visual assessment
- Dual representation supports different user preferences
- Addresses both analytical and visual learning styles

**Implementation:**
- Numeric display prominent at top
- Horizontal progress bar below with color coding
- Responsive sizing for mobile devices

**Owner:** Lisa Park (mockups), Priya Sharma (implementation)

### Decision 2: Contribution History Pagination
**Choice:** 20 items per page

**Rationale:**
- Performance optimization for users with extensive history
- Prevents overwhelming single-page load
- Standard pagination pattern familiar to users
- Balances information density with usability

**Implementation:**
- Standard pagination controls at bottom
- Page number display and navigation
- "Items per page" option for power users

**Owner:** Priya Sharma (implementation)

### Decision 3: Admin Approval Notifications
**Choice:** Email notifications to both admins and members

**Rationale:**
- Keeps admins informed of pending approvals
- Notifies members when contributions are processed
- Reduces support queries about approval status
- Increases transparency and trust

**Notification Triggers:**
- Member submits contribution → Admin receives notification
- Admin approves/rejects → Member receives notification
- Weekly digest for pending approvals

**Owner:** Emma Rodriguez (requirements), Priya Sharma (implementation)

### Decision 4: Priority Status Visual Recognition
**Choice:** Star icon for priority reservations

**Rationale:**
- Universal symbol for importance/priority
- Easily recognizable at a glance
- Works well at small sizes
- Accessible with proper alt text

**Implementation:**
- Gold star icon next to reservation listings
- Tooltip explaining priority benefit
- Consistent placement across UI

**Owner:** Lisa Park (design), Priya Sharma (implementation)

## Technical Feasibility Assessment

**Priya Sharma's Assessment:** ✅ All designs are technically feasible

**Key Technical Considerations:**
1. **Credit Balance Display:** Simple component with props for value and max
2. **Progress Bar:** CSS-based implementation, performant
3. **Pagination:** Standard pattern, backend API support required
4. **Email Notifications:** Leverage existing email service
5. **Responsive Design:** CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
6. **Star Icon:** SVG icon, scalable and accessible

**No technical blockers identified.**

---

## Accessibility Considerations

**Requirements Met:**
- ✅ WCAG AA compliance
- ✅ Color contrast ratios verified (4.5:1 minimum)
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support
- ✅ Screen reader compatibility
  - Progress bar has aria-label with percentage
  - Star icon has descriptive alt text
  - Form inputs have proper labels
- ✅ Focus indicators visible
- ✅ Alternative text for all icons and images
- ✅ Form labels and error messages clear

**Testing Plan:**
- Automated accessibility scanning (axe DevTools)
- Manual keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing (NVDA, VoiceOver)

---

## Open Questions

### Resolved During Meeting ✅
1. ~~Should credit balance show total earned or current balance?~~
   **Decision:** Current balance (after redemptions) - more actionable for users

2. ~~How many contribution types in initial release?~~
   **Decision:** Three types (Time, Skills, Resources) - covers primary use cases

3. ~~Should admin approval be required for all contribution types?~~
   **Decision:** Yes - ensures quality and prevents gaming the system

4. ~~Mobile-first or desktop-first design approach?~~
   **Decision:** Desktop-first given primary admin use case, but fully responsive
