# Prompt for your AI assistant

Help me configure my MCP server to work with my AI coding assistant.

I need to:

1. Use MCP Inspector to generate the proper configuration entry for my server
2. Add the configuration to Claude Desktop (or my chosen assistant)
3. Test that the assistant can discover and use my tools
4. Verify that the assistant can chain multiple tool calls together
5. Test a realistic workflow like checking deployment status, then getting related metrics

Please help me:

- Generate the MCP Inspector configuration command for my server
- Walk through adding the server to my AI assistant's configuration
- Test the integration with real DevOps scenarios

## Expected Outcome

- Working integration with AI assistant
- Ability to use DevOps tools through natural language
- Successful multi-step workflows (e.g., check deployments → get metrics → check health)
