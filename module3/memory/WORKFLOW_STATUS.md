# Workflow & Status

## Overview

This document establishes a rigorous four-stage development process that ensures consistent, high-quality software delivery. Every work item must progress through all stages sequentially, with explicit user approval required for stage transitions.

## Four-Stage Development Process

### Stage 1: PLAN

**Purpose**: Establish clear direction and success criteria before any implementation begins.

**Activities**:
- **Story Planning**: Define complete feature scope with business value statement
- **Task Planning**: Break down into Given-When-Then acceptance criteria scenarios
- **Test Strategy**: Identify testing approach and coverage requirements
- **File Change Identification**: Map which files will be modified or created
- **Branch Creation**: Create feature branch following naming conventions
- **Plan Commitment**: Lock in the plan before proceeding

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] Story has clear business value statement
- [ ] All tasks defined with Given-When-Then format
- [ ] Test strategy documented for each task
- [ ] File changes identified and validated
- [ ] Feature branch created and checked out
- [ ] Working document created and committed
- [ ] **USER APPROVAL REQUIRED** to advance to Stage 2

**Quality Gate**: Plan must be complete, coherent, and committed before implementation begins.

---

### Stage 2: BUILD & ASSESS

**Purpose**: Implement the planned solution while continuously validating quality and requirements.

**Activities**:
- **Implementation Loop**: Write code according to planned file changes
- **Testing Loop**: Create and execute tests for each Given-When-Then scenario
- **Quality Validation**: Run complete quality suite after each significant change
- **Assessment**: Validate implementation against acceptance criteria
- **Iteration**: Refine implementation until all criteria are satisfied

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] All planned file changes implemented
- [ ] All Given-When-Then scenarios pass
- [ ] Quality validation passes cleanly (no warnings)
- [ ] Code coverage meets requirements
- [ ] Implementation matches planned scope exactly
- [ ] **USER APPROVAL REQUIRED** to advance to Stage 3

**Quality Gate**: All tests pass, quality validation is clean, and acceptance criteria are fully satisfied.

**Critical Protocol**: Quality validation must pass **without warnings**. Any warnings must be resolved before stage completion.

---

### Stage 3: REFLECT & ADAPT

**Purpose**: Capture learnings and optimize future development cycles.

**Activities**:
- **Process Assessment**: Evaluate what worked well and what didn't
- **Improvement Identification**: Document specific process enhancements

- [ ] Improvement opportunities identified
- [ ] Future tasks reviewed and prioritized
- [ ] Lessons learned captured in working document
- [ ] Process adaptations planned for next cycle
- [ ] **USER APPROVAL REQUIRED** to advance to Stage 4

**Quality Gate**: Reflection is thorough and actionable improvements are identified.

---

### Stage 4: COMMIT & PICK NEXT

**Purpose**: Finalize current work and transition smoothly to the next development cycle.

**Activities**:
- **Commit Creation**: Create conventional commit with clear, descriptive message
- **Branch Management**: Merge feature branch and clean up
- **Next Task Selection**: Choose next task based on priority and dependencies
- **Status Update**: Update working document and project status
- **Cycle Transition**: Prepare for next PLAN stage

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] Conventional commit created with proper format
- [ ] Feature branch merged to main/develop
- [ ] Local branches cleaned up

## Critical Process Rules

### Non-Negotiable Protocols

1. **User-Driven Progression**: Only the user can advance between stages. The assistant **cannot** move to the next stage without explicit user approval.

2. **Complete Stage Completion**: All completion criteria must be satisfied before stage transition. No partial completions allowed.

3. **Quality Validation Requirement**: Quality checks must pass **cleanly without warnings** before advancing from Stage 2.

4. **Sequential Processing**: Stages must be completed in order. No skipping or parallel processing.

5. **Documentation Integrity**: Working document must accurately reflect current status and be updated at each stage transition.

### Stage Transition Protocol

**Assistant Responsibilities**:
- Complete all activities for current stage
- Validate all completion criteria
- Present stage summary to user
- **Request explicit permission** to advance

**User Responsibilities**:
- Review stage completion summary
- Validate quality and completeness
- **Explicitly approve** stage advancement
- Provide guidance for process improvements

## Work Item Structure & Organization

### Story
- **Definition**: Complete feature that delivers business value to users
- **Scope**: End-to-end functionality that can be demonstrated and validated
- **Composition**: Contains 1-N tasks that collectively implement the feature
- **Acceptance**: Must satisfy business requirements and user needs
- **Storage**: Stored as markdown files in `changes/` directory

### Task
- **Definition**: Single Given-When-Then scenario within a story
- **Scope**: Atomic unit of work that can be completed in one development cycle
- **Format**: Structured as behavioral specification with clear success criteria
- **Validation**: Must be testable and demonstrable
- **Tracking**: Tracked within parent story document with individual status

### Working Document Pattern
- **Purpose**: Real-time tracking and status management for AI assistant guidance
- **Structure**: Template-based with consistent sections for clarity and support
- **Content**: Current status, completion criteria, notes, context, and history
- **Location**: Stored in `changes/` directory with descriptive filenames
- **Assistant Support**: Provides sufficient context for AI to maintain focus and direction

### Changes Directory Structure
```
changes/
â”œâ”€â”€ 001-story-user-authentication.md       # Numbered story files
â”œâ”€â”€ 002-story-dashboard-redesign.md        # Sequential numbering
â”œâ”€â”€ 003-story-api-rate-limiting.md         # One file per story
â””â”€â”€ archived/                              # Completed stories
    â”œâ”€â”€ 001-story-login-system.md          # Moved after completion
    â””â”€â”€ 002-story-user-profile.md          # Maintains numbering
```

### File Naming Convention
- **Format**: `[XXX]-story-[descriptive-name].md` (where XXX is a 3-digit number)
- **Examples**: 
  - `001-story-user-authentication.md`
  - `002-story-payment-integration.md`
  - `003-story-dashboard-redesign.md`
- **Numbering**: Sequential 3-digit numbers (001, 002, 003, etc.)
- **Rationale**: Numbered sequence provides chronological order, clear searchability, and AI-friendly naming that promotes understanding of work progression
