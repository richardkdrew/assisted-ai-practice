# Feature Specification: STDIO MCP Server

**Feature Branch**: `001-stdio-mcp-server`
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "stdio-mcp-server: Build a minimal, functional MCP (Model Context Protocol) server using STDIO communication. The server will use the official MCP Python SDK, managed with UV for dependency management. It must handle protocol handshake, initialize properly, support STDIO transport (stdin/stdout for protocol, stderr for logs), implement proper error handling and structured logging, and support graceful shutdown. The server should be testable with MCP Inspector and configurable via .mcp.json for Claude Desktop integration."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer integrating MCP capabilities into desktop applications (like Claude Desktop), I need a server that can communicate via standard input/output streams to enable AI assistants to access tools, resources, and prompts without requiring network infrastructure.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the MCP server is not running, **When** a client application starts the server process, **Then** the server initializes successfully and is ready to accept MCP protocol messages via stdin

2. **Given** the server is initialized, **When** the client sends an MCP initialization handshake request, **Then** the server responds with its capabilities and establishes the protocol session

3. **Given** the server is running normally, **When** the client sends properly formatted JSON-RPC messages via stdin, **Then** the server processes them and returns valid JSON-RPC responses via stdout

4. **Given** the server encounters an error (malformed message, internal failure), **When** processing a request, **Then** the server logs diagnostic information to stderr and returns an appropriate error response without crashing

5. **Given** the server is running, **When** the client signals shutdown (SIGINT or SIGTERM), **Then** the server gracefully closes resources and exits cleanly

6. **Given** a developer wants to test the server, **When** they run MCP Inspector, **Then** the inspector successfully connects and displays server information

7. **Given** the server needs to be integrated with Claude Desktop, **When** configured in .mcp.json, **Then** Claude Desktop can launch and communicate with the server

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the server receives malformed JSON that cannot be parsed?
  - Server logs error to stderr and returns JSON-RPC error response without crashing

- What happens when stdin is closed unexpectedly?
  - Server detects EOF condition and initiates graceful shutdown

- What happens when the client sends messages faster than the server can process?
  - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: buffering strategy - should server queue, drop, or backpressure?]

- How does the system handle very large messages?
  - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum message size limits not specified]

- What happens during initialization if the server cannot allocate required resources?
  - Server logs error to stderr and exits with non-zero status code before accepting requests

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Server MUST accept MCP protocol messages via standard input (stdin)

- **FR-002**: Server MUST send MCP protocol responses via standard output (stdout)

- **FR-003**: Server MUST send all diagnostic logging, errors, and debug information to standard error (stderr) only

- **FR-004**: Server MUST implement the MCP protocol initialization handshake sequence

- **FR-005**: Server MUST advertise its capabilities during initialization

- **FR-006**: Server MUST parse incoming JSON-RPC 2.0 formatted messages

- **FR-007**: Server MUST validate message format and protocol version compatibility

- **FR-008**: Server MUST handle errors explicitly for all external interactions (I/O operations, JSON parsing, protocol messages)

- **FR-009**: Server MUST log all errors with structured information including timestamp, severity level, and context

- **FR-010**: Server MUST respond to graceful shutdown signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM) by cleaning up resources and exiting

- **FR-011**: Server MUST NOT crash when receiving malformed or invalid messages

- **FR-012**: Server MUST be verifiable via MCP Inspector tool

- **FR-013**: Server MUST be configurable via .mcp.json configuration file for client integration

- **FR-014**: Server MUST initialize and be ready to accept requests within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: startup time requirement not specified - e.g., 5 seconds?]

- **FR-015**: Server MUST maintain protocol state across multiple request/response cycles in a session

### Key Entities

- **MCP Server**: The server process that implements Model Context Protocol, manages lifecycle (initialization, request handling, shutdown), maintains protocol state, and provides logging/diagnostics

- **Protocol Session**: Represents the communication session between client and server, tracks initialization state, protocol version negotiation, and capability advertisement

- **Message**: JSON-RPC 2.0 formatted data exchanged between client and server, includes requests (from client) and responses/errors (from server)

- **Server Capabilities**: Set of features the server supports (tools, resources, prompts), advertised during initialization

## Notes

**Clarifications Needed**:
1. Message buffering strategy when client sends requests faster than server can process
2. Maximum message size limits for protocol messages
3. Startup time performance requirement

**Assumptions**:
- Server runs as a child process launched by client application
- Single client per server instance (one-to-one communication model)
- Server does not need to persist state between runs
- MCP Inspector is the primary testing tool
- Claude Desktop is the primary integration target
