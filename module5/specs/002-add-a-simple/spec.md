# Feature Specification: Add Ping Tool to MCP Server

**Feature Branch**: `002-add-a-simple`
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "add a simple ping tool to my MCP server in stdio_server to test connectivity. The ping tool should accept a message parameter (string) and return a response like Pong: {message}. It should be properly registered with the MCP server and include appropriate input schema validation"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature request is clear: add ping tool for connectivity testing
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: MCP client users, MCP server
   ‚Üí Actions: send ping message, receive pong response
   ‚Üí Data: message string (input), pong response (output)
   ‚Üí Constraints: input validation required
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí No major ambiguities identified
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow: Client sends ping ‚Üí Server responds with pong
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements are testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Single entity: PingMessage
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   ‚Üí No implementation details included
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user (or system administrator) needs to verify that the MCP server is running and responsive. They send a test message to the server and expect to receive a response that confirms both connectivity and message handling are working correctly.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the MCP server is running, **When** a user sends a ping with message "test", **Then** the server responds with "Pong: test"
2. **Given** the MCP server is running, **When** a user sends a ping with an empty message "", **Then** the server responds with "Pong: "
3. **Given** the MCP server is running, **When** a user sends a ping with a long message (1000+ characters), **Then** the server responds with "Pong: [full message]"
4. **Given** the MCP server is running, **When** a user sends a ping with special characters "Hello! @#$% ‰∏ñÁïå", **Then** the server responds with "Pong: Hello! @#$% ‰∏ñÁïå"

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the message parameter is missing entirely? System must reject the request with a validation error.
- What happens when the message contains null bytes or invalid UTF-8? System must handle gracefully with appropriate error message.
- What happens when multiple ping requests are sent simultaneously? Each must receive its corresponding response without mixing messages.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a "ping" tool accessible via the MCP protocol
- **FR-002**: The ping tool MUST accept a single parameter named "message" of type string
- **FR-003**: The ping tool MUST validate that the "message" parameter is provided
- **FR-004**: The ping tool MUST return a response in the format "Pong: {message}" where {message} is the exact input provided
- **FR-005**: The ping tool MUST preserve the entire message content including whitespace and special characters
- **FR-006**: The ping tool MUST be registered with the MCP server and discoverable by MCP clients
- **FR-007**: The ping tool MUST include schema validation that enforces the message parameter is a string type
- **FR-008**: The ping tool MUST return an error if the message parameter is missing or invalid type

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **PingMessage**: Represents the test message sent by a client
  - Attributes: message content (string, required)
  - Purpose: Verify server connectivity and message handling
  - Validation: Must be a string, no length restrictions
  - Response: Echoed back with "Pong: " prefix
