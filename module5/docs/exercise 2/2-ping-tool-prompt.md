Now I need to add a simple "ping" tool to my MCP server to test connectivity.

The ping tool should:

- Accept a "message" parameter (string)
- Return a response like "Pong: {message}" 
- Be properly registered with the MCP server
- Include appropriate input schema validation

Please create an implementation plan for adding this ping tool.

## Expected Outcome

- Working ping tool that responds to MCP tool calls
- Proper tool registration and schema definition
- You can wait to verify this is all working until the next step
