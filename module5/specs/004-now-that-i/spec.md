# Feature Specification: Additional DevOps CLI Tools (list-releases & check-health)

**Feature Branch**: `004-now-that-i`
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Now that I have a working subprocess wrapper and one tool, I'd like to implement the remaining core tools: 1. list-releases - wraps ./devops-cli releases --app {app} --limit {limit} --format json 2. check-health - wraps ./devops-cli health --env {env} --format json. Each tool should: Use the same subprocess wrapper we created, Validate input parameters appropriately, Handle and report errors consistently"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: What should `list-releases` do when the `app` parameter is NOT provided? → A: Return error - app parameter is required
- Q: What are the valid values for the `limit` parameter in `list-releases`? → A: Any positive integer (1 to unlimited)
- Q: What are the valid environment names for the `env` parameter in `check-health`? → A: prod, staging, uat, dev (case-insensitive)
- Q: What should `check-health` do when the `env` parameter is NOT provided? → A: Check health for ALL environments
- Q: Should the timeout for CLI execution be configurable per tool or use a shared default? → A: Shared default timeout (30s) for all tools

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature requests two new MCP tools leveraging existing subprocess wrapper
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: DevOps engineers, SREs, automation systems
   → Actions: list releases, check health status
   → Data: release history, health metrics
   → Constraints: use existing wrapper, validate inputs, consistent error handling
3. Clarifications resolved:
   → app parameter: required (error if missing)
   → limit parameter: any positive integer (1+)
   → env parameter: prod|staging|uat|dev (case-insensitive), optional (defaults to all)
   → timeout: shared 30s default across all tools
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → User can query release history for applications
   → User can check health status of environments
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement testable against CLI wrapper behavior
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Release (version, app, metadata)
   → Health Check (environment, status, metrics)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → All critical ambiguities resolved
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a DevOps engineer or SRE, I need to query release history and check environment health status through MCP tools, so that I can gather deployment information and monitor system health without manually running CLI commands.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### list-releases Tool
1. **Given** a valid application name, **When** I call list-releases with app parameter, **Then** I receive a list of recent releases for that application in JSON format
2. **Given** a valid application name and limit, **When** I call list-releases with both parameters, **Then** I receive up to 'limit' number of releases
3. **Given** an invalid application name, **When** I call list-releases, **Then** I receive a clear error message indicating the application is invalid
4. **Given** no app parameter, **When** I call list-releases, **Then** I receive an error stating that app parameter is required
5. **Given** limit is 0 or negative, **When** I call list-releases, **Then** I receive an error stating limit must be a positive integer

#### check-health Tool
1. **Given** a valid environment name (prod/staging/uat/dev), **When** I call check-health with env parameter, **Then** I receive health status and metrics for that environment in JSON format
2. **Given** an invalid environment name, **When** I call check-health, **Then** I receive a clear error message indicating the environment is invalid
3. **Given** no environment parameter, **When** I call check-health, **Then** I receive health status for ALL environments (prod, staging, uat, dev)
4. **Given** environment name in mixed case (e.g., "PROD", "Staging"), **When** I call check-health, **Then** it matches case-insensitively and returns correct results

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the DevOps CLI tool is not found or not executable? → Return structured error with clear message
- What happens when the CLI tool times out during execution (>30s)? → Return timeout error with details
- What happens when the CLI returns malformed JSON? → Return parse error with diagnostic information
- What happens when the CLI returns a non-zero exit code but valid JSON? → Return error with CLI exit code and stderr
- What happens when parameters contain special characters or shell metacharacters? → Validation prevents injection; invalid chars rejected
- What happens when limit is set to 0, negative, or excessively large value? → 0/negative rejected; large values passed to CLI (CLI enforces its own limits)
- How does the system handle concurrent requests to the same tool? → Each request independent; no shared state conflicts

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### list-releases Tool
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a list-releases tool that queries release history for applications
- **FR-002**: System MUST require an 'app' parameter and return an error if not provided
- **FR-003**: System MUST accept an optional 'limit' parameter to restrict the number of releases returned
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate that 'app' parameter is a non-empty string
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate that 'limit' parameter (if provided) is a positive integer (≥1)
- **FR-006**: System MUST return release data in JSON format matching the CLI tool's output structure
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle CLI execution errors with clear, actionable error messages

#### check-health Tool
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a check-health tool that queries environment health status
- **FR-009**: System MUST accept an optional 'env' parameter to specify which environment to check
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate the 'env' parameter against allowed values: prod, staging, uat, dev (case-insensitive)
- **FR-011**: System MUST check ALL environments when 'env' parameter is not provided
- **FR-012**: System MUST return health status data in JSON format matching the CLI tool's output structure
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle CLI execution errors with clear, actionable error messages

#### Shared Requirements (Both Tools)
- **FR-014**: System MUST use the existing subprocess wrapper (execute_cli_command) for all CLI interactions
- **FR-015**: System MUST follow the same error handling patterns as the existing get_deployment_status tool
- **FR-016**: System MUST validate all user inputs before passing to the CLI to prevent injection attacks
- **FR-017**: System MUST use a shared default timeout of 30 seconds for all CLI executions
- **FR-018**: System MUST log all CLI invocations and results to stderr for debugging
- **FR-019**: System MUST return structured error responses when the CLI tool fails or is unavailable
- **FR-020**: System MUST parse and validate JSON output from CLI before returning to caller

  - Environment identifier (prod, staging, uat, dev)
  - Overall health status (healthy, degraded, unhealthy)
  - Health metrics and measurements
