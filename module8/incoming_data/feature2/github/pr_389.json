    "description": "## Overview\n\nImplements QR code based check-in/out system for equipment as specified in PLAT-1687.\n\n## Features Implemented\n\n- **QR Code Generation**: Backend service to generate unique QR codes for each equipment item\n- **QR Code Scanning**: Mobile app capability to scan QR codes using device camera\n- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live checkout status updates\n- **Mobile App**: React Native app for iOS and Android with QR scanner\n- **API Endpoints**: RESTful endpoints for QR generation, validation, and checkout operations\n- **Security**: Token-based QR codes with expiration and single-use validation\n\n## Changes Made\n\n### Backend\n- Added `QRCodeService` for token generation and validation\n- Implemented `/api/equipment/:id/qr-code` endpoint (POST)\n- Implemented `/api/equipment/qr-scan` endpoint (POST)\n- Added WebSocket event handlers for real-time updates\n- Created `qr_codes` database table with token, equipment, and expiry tracking\n- Updated `checkouts` table to include QR-based checkout flag\n\n### Mobile App\n- Scaffolded React Native application with TypeScript\n- Integrated `react-native-camera` for QR scanning\n- Implemented authentication flow with JWT tokens\n- Created equipment list and checkout history screens\n- Added WebSocket client for real-time notifications\n- Implemented offline mode with queue sync\n\n### Tests\n- Unit tests for QR code generation and validation\n- Integration tests for API endpoints\n- Mobile app component tests\n- WebSocket scalability tests (some failures noted)\n\n## Known Issues\n\n⚠️ **Race Condition**: There's a known race condition in QR code invalidation when multiple users scan the same code simultaneously. Attempted fix in commit `commit_006_bug_fix_qr_invalidation.diff` but issue persists under high load.\n\n⚠️ **WebSocket Scalability**: Connection limit issues observed with 500+ concurrent users. 7 integration tests failing related to WebSocket stability.\n\n⚠️ **Security Concerns**: Security scan identified 1 critical and 3 high severity vulnerabilities (see security review).\n\n## Testing\n\n- ✅ Unit Tests: 156 passed, 2 failed (race condition, token expiry edge case)\n- ⚠️ Integration Tests: 18 passed, 7 failed (WebSocket under load)\n- ❌ UAT: Blocked due to critical bugs\n- ❌ Security Review: In progress, blocking issues identified\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- `qrcode`: ^1.5.3\n- `socket.io`: ^4.6.1\n- `react-native-camera`: ^4.2.1\n- `jsonwebtoken`: ^9.0.2\n\n## Migration Plan\n\n1. Deploy backend changes to staging\n2. Run database migrations (new qr_codes table)\n3. Deploy mobile app to TestFlight/Play Store Beta\n4. Monitor WebSocket server load\n5. Roll out to 10% of users initially\n\n## Rollback Plan\n\n- Backend: Revert database migrations, disable QR endpoints\n- Mobile: Force update to previous version, hide QR feature flag\n- Data: QR codes stored separately, no impact on existing checkout data\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- Jira: PLAT-1687 (parent feature)\n- Blocks: PLAT-1688 (Equipment Dashboard Redesign)\n- Blocked by: PLAT-1702 (WebSocket race condition), PLAT-1703 (QR security vulnerability)\n\n## Reviewers\n\n@michael.rodriguez (Backend Lead) - APPROVED with comments\n@jessica.park (Mobile Lead) - APPROVED with comments\n@david.thompson (Security) - REQUESTED CHANGES\n@emma.wilson (QA Lead) - Awaiting fixes before review\n\n## Checklist\n\n- [x] Code follows style guidelines\n- [x] Tests added and passing (mostly)\n- [ ] Security review complete\n- [ ] Documentation updated\n- [ ] UAT completed\n- [ ] Performance benchmarks met\n- [ ] Mobile app ready for release",
