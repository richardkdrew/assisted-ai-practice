# Integrate Learning with Reflection

1. How did you find collaborating with your assistant on the context docs given it can read the implementation? Did you collaborate using different models?

2. Did you ever end up with too much memory for your context window and necessary session lengths?

3. How eager was your assistant? How much did you have to delete or ask them to remove? Did you try to mitigate this for similar tasks in the future? Did your mitigations work?

4. How reliable was your assistant at loading the context? Were you able to use reliably use command phrases?

Before the next time we meet, please post a link to your repo and your reflections to Discord.
