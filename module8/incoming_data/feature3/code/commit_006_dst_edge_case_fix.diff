    Attempt to fix DST edge case bugs
    
    Addresses daylight saving time transition issues reported in integration tests.
    Changes:
    - Added Luxon.js library for timezone-aware datetime handling
    - Implemented DST transition detection logic
    - Added handling for "spring forward" (invalid times)
    - Added handling for "fall back" (ambiguous times)
    - Updated duration calculation to account for DST
    
    Status: Partial fix
    - Spring forward detection working
    - Fall back handling improved
    - 3 integration tests still failing (rare edge cases)
    - Non-blocking for initial release

[Implementation includes Luxon integration for DST handling, but edge cases remain.
Tests show improvement but 3 scenarios still fail at DST boundaries]
