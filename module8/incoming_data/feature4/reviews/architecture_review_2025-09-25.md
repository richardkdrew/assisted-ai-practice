# Architecture Review: Community Contributions & Credit System

## Meeting Overview

**Purpose:** Review and approve the technical architecture for the Community Contributions & Credit System feature before implementation begins.

**Outcome:** ✅ **APPROVED**

---

## Reviewers & Roles

- **James Wilson** (Tech Lead) - Led architecture review and technical assessment
- **Michael Chen** (CTO) - Validated architectural decisions and scalability considerations
- **Sarah Chen** (Senior Software Engineer) - Assessed implementation feasibility and data model design

---

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision 1: Use Polymorphic Data Model with JSONB for Contribution Types
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

**Decision:**
Implement a polymorphic data model using PostgreSQL JSONB columns to store contribution-type-specific data, rather than separate tables for each contribution type.

**Rationale:**
- Provides flexibility for future contribution types without schema changes
- Eliminates need to modify database schema when adding new contribution types
- JSONB allows indexing and querying of specific fields when needed
- Single table simplifies queries and reduces JOIN complexity
- PostgreSQL JSONB performance is excellent for this use case

**Implementation Approach:**
- Base `contributions` table with common fields (id, member_id, type, status, created_at)
- `contribution_data` JSONB column for type-specific fields
- GIN indexes on JSONB for frequently queried fields
- Type-specific validation at application layer

**Approved By:** James Wilson, Michael Chen, Sarah Chen

### Decision 2: Background Job for Credit Calculation Runs Nightly at 3 AM UTC
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

**Decision:**
Run credit calculation and recalculation as a nightly background job scheduled for 3 AM UTC.

**Rationale:**
- 3 AM UTC is a low-traffic period for the application
- Sufficient frequency for daily credit recalculation needs
- Batch processing more efficient than real-time calculation
- Reduces load on database during peak hours
- Allows for complex calculation logic without impacting user experience
- Easier to monitor and debug than real-time processing

**Implementation Approach:**
- Scheduled job using existing job queue system
- Process all pending contributions approved in last 24 hours
- Update member credit balances in bulk
- Send notification emails after calculations complete
- Comprehensive logging for audit trail

**Monitoring:**
- Job completion time tracking
- Alert if job exceeds 30 minutes
- Daily success/failure notifications to engineering team

**Approved By:** James Wilson, Michael Chen, Sarah Chen

### Decision 3: Priority Queue Integration Modifies Reservation System Waitlist Query
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

**Decision:**
Integrate priority queue functionality by modifying the existing reservation system waitlist query to prioritize members with sufficient credits.

**Rationale:**
- Minimal changes to existing reservation system architecture
- Backward compatible with current waitlist functionality
- Performant with proper indexing on credit balance
- No need for separate priority queue data structure
- Simpler to maintain than parallel queue systems
- Query optimization can handle priority sorting efficiently

**Implementation Approach:**
- Add `ORDER BY credit_balance DESC, created_at ASC` to waitlist query
- Index on `(credit_balance, created_at)` for query performance
- Fallback to FIFO ordering for members with equal credits
- No changes required to existing waitlist UI components

**Performance Considerations:**
- Index maintains performance even with large waitlists
- Query plan analysis shows no degradation
- Load testing confirms <50ms response time with 10k waitlist entries

**Approved By:** James Wilson, Michael Chen, Sarah Chen

### Decision 4: Audit Trail Using credit_transactions Table
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

**Decision:**
Implement comprehensive audit trail using a dedicated `credit_transactions` table to track all credit-related activities.

**Rationale:**
- Complete traceability of all credit changes
- Compliance requirements for financial-like systems
- Debugging support for credit calculation issues
- Member transparency - can view full transaction history
- Immutable record for dispute resolution
- Enables detailed analytics and reporting

**Implementation Approach:**
- `credit_transactions` table with fields:
  - id, member_id, transaction_type, amount, balance_before, balance_after
  - contribution_id (nullable, for contribution-related transactions)
  - created_at, created_by, description
- Transaction types: EARNED, REDEEMED, ADJUSTED, EXPIRED
- Triggers or application-level logic to ensure all changes logged
- Never delete transactions (soft delete only if needed)

**Data Retention:**
- Retain all transaction records indefinitely
- Partition table by year for performance (if needed)
- Archive old records to cold storage after 2 years

**Approved By:** James Wilson, Michael Chen, Sarah Chen

## Concerns Raised

**None** - No concerns were raised during the architecture review.

All reviewers were satisfied with the proposed architecture and technical decisions.

---

## Recommendations

### Future Optimization Considerations

**1. Consider Redis Caching for Credit Balances**
- **When:** If query load increases significantly post-launch
- **Approach:** Cache member credit balances in Redis with TTL
- **Benefit:** Reduce database query load for frequently accessed balances
- **Trigger:** Monitor database query metrics; implement if p95 latency exceeds 100ms

**2. Monitor Database Query Performance After Production Deployment**
- **Action:** Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- **Metrics to Track:**
  - Query execution time for credit balance lookups
  - Waitlist query performance with priority ordering
  - JSONB query performance on contribution_data
  - Index utilization statistics
- **Alert Thresholds:** p95 > 100ms, p99 > 200ms
- **Review Cadence:** Weekly for first month, then monthly

**3. Plan for Table Partitioning if Contributions Exceed 10M Rows**
- **Trigger:** Monitor row count; plan partitioning when approaching 5M rows
- **Strategy:** Partition by year or quarter based on created_at
- **Tables to Partition:**
  - `contributions` table
  - `credit_transactions` table
- **Benefit:** Improved query performance and easier data archival
