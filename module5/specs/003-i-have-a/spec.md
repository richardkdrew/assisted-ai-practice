# Feature Specification: DevOps CLI Wrapper for MCP Server

**Feature Branch**: `003-i-have-a`
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I have a CLI tool at ./acme-devops-cli/devops-cli that I need to wrap with my MCP server. Please create an implementation plan that maps CLI commands to MCP tools: 1. Discover what commands this CLI tool supports by running ./acme-devops-cli/devops-cli --help 2. Test a few commands to understand the output format 3. Design a strategy for wrapping these CLI commands as MCP tools"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input 
   ’ User wants to wrap DevOps CLI tool as MCP tools
2. Extract key concepts from description 
   ’ Actor: MCP clients (Claude Desktop, etc.)
   ’ Actions: Get deployment status, list releases, check health, promote releases
   ’ Data: Deployment information, release metadata, health metrics
   ’ Constraints: CLI tool located at ./acme-devops-cli/devops-cli
3. For each unclear aspect: 
   ’ All commands discovered and tested
   ’ Output format confirmed (JSON by default)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section 
   ’ 4 primary scenarios (one per CLI command)
5. Generate Functional Requirements 
   ’ 4 MCP tools matching CLI commands
6. Identify Key Entities 
   ’ Deployment, Release, HealthCheck, PromotionRequest
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   ’ Focus on user capabilities, not implementation
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an MCP client user (e.g., using Claude Desktop), I want to interact with the DevOps CLI tool through natural language conversations, so that I can query deployment status, view releases, check health, and promote releases without needing to remember exact CLI syntax or switch to a terminal.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I'm using an MCP-enabled client, **When** I ask "What's the deployment status of web-app in production?", **Then** I receive structured deployment information including version, deploy time, and commit hash

2. **Given** I'm investigating recent changes, **When** I request "Show me the last 5 releases", **Then** I receive a list of recent releases with version numbers, dates, authors, and release notes

3. **Given** I'm concerned about system stability, **When** I ask "What's the health status of production?", **Then** I receive health metrics for all production services including error rates, performance scores, and rollback recommendations

4. **Given** I want to promote a release, **When** I specify "Promote web-app version v2.1.4 from staging to production", **Then** the system simulates the promotion and returns success/failure status

### Edge Cases

- What happens when filtering by an application that doesn't exist? (Empty results with appropriate status message)
- How does the system handle when the CLI tool returns an error? (Error message passed through to user)
- What if CLI output format changes? (JSON parsing errors should be clearly reported)
- How are CLI tool execution failures handled? (Exit codes and stderr captured and reported)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST expose a "get_deployment_status" capability that retrieves deployment information for applications across environments

- **FR-002**: System MUST support filtering deployment status by application ID (e.g., "web-app", "api-service") and/or environment (e.g., "prod", "staging", "uat")

- **FR-003**: System MUST expose a "list_releases" capability that shows recent version deployments across applications

- **FR-004**: System MUST support limiting the number of releases returned and filtering by application ID

- **FR-005**: System MUST expose a "check_health" capability that retrieves health status for services across environments

- **FR-006**: System MUST support filtering health checks by environment and/or application ID

- **FR-007**: System MUST expose a "promote_release" capability that simulates promoting a release from one environment to another

- **FR-008**: System MUST require application ID, version, source environment, and target environment for promotions

- **FR-009**: System MUST return structured data (JSON format) from all CLI tool interactions

- **FR-010**: System MUST handle CLI tool errors gracefully and report them to the user

- **FR-011**: System MUST execute CLI commands as subprocess calls to ./acme-devops-cli/devops-cli

- **FR-012**: System MUST parse JSON output from CLI tool and return it to MCP clients

### Key Entities

- **Deployment**: Represents a deployed application instance with attributes: deployment ID, application ID, environment, version, deployment status, timestamp, deployer identity, commit hash

- **Release**: Represents a versioned release with attributes: release ID, application ID, version number, release date, release notes, author, commit hash, associated deployment IDs

- **HealthCheck**: Represents health status for a deployed service with attributes: release ID, application ID, version, environment, overall status (healthy/degraded/unhealthy), deployment success flag, error rate, performance score, rollback recommendation, subsystem health checks (database, cache, external APIs), last checked timestamp

- **PromotionRequest**: Represents a release promotion operation with attributes: application ID, version number, source environment, target environment, promotion status, timestamp
