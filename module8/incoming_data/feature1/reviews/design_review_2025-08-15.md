## Discussion Points & Decisions

### 1. Calendar Library Selection

**Question:** Which calendar library should we use for the frontend?

**Options Discussed:**
- FullCalendar.js
- React Big Calendar
- Custom implementation

**Decision:** âœ… **Use FullCalendar.js**

**Rationale:**
- Robust feature set out of the box
- Good mobile support
- Widely used and well-maintained
- Supports recurring events natively
- Good documentation and community support

**Action Items:**
- [x] Confirm FullCalendar.js licensing (Completed 2025-08-17)
- [x] Create calendar component prototype (Completed 2025-08-20)

---

### 2. Alert Notification Preferences

**Question:** Should alert preferences be per-user or per-resource?

**Options Discussed:**
- Per-user: User sets global preferences for all resources
- Per-resource: User can customize alerts for each resource
- Per-schedule: User can customize alerts for each schedule

**Decision:** âœ… **Per-user with optional per-schedule overrides**

**Rationale:**
- Most users want consistent alert behavior
- Power users need flexibility for critical resources
- Reduces cognitive load for casual users
- Easier to implement and maintain

**Design Impact:**
- Global preferences in user settings
- Optional "Custom alerts" checkbox on schedule form
- Clear visual indication when using custom settings

**Action Items:**
- [x] Update wireframes with global preferences UI (Completed 2025-08-16)
- [x] Add custom alert override UI to schedule form (Completed 2025-08-16)

---

### 3. Maintenance Type Color Coding

**Question:** Should we use color coding to differentiate maintenance types?

**Suggested by:** Emma Rodriguez

**Decision:** âœ… **Yes, implement color coding**

**Color Scheme Approved:**
- ðŸŸ¢ Green: Routine maintenance (regular, expected)
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Preventive maintenance (important, not urgent)
- ðŸ”´ Red: Urgent maintenance (requires immediate attention)
- ðŸ”µ Blue: Inspection (assessment, no work required)

**Design Impact:**
- Calendar events color-coded by type
- Legend displayed prominently
- Colors meet WCAG AA accessibility standards
- Alternative text indicators for colorblind users

**Action Items:**
- [x] Update mockups with color coding (Completed 2025-08-17)
- [x] Create legend component (Completed 2025-08-18)
- [x] Accessibility audit of color choices (Completed 2025-08-18)

---

### 4. Photo Upload for Maintenance Completion

**Question:** Should users be able to upload photos when logging maintenance completion?

**Suggested by:** Michael Torres (based on user research)

**Decision:** âœ… **Yes, but make it optional**

**Rationale:**
- User research shows community admins want visual proof
- Helps with quality assurance
- Useful for recurring issues
- Should not be required to avoid friction

**Design Impact:**
- Photo upload widget on maintenance log form
- Support for multiple photos (max 5)
- Thumbnail preview before submission
- Gallery view in maintenance history

**Action Items:**
- [x] Design photo upload interface (Completed 2025-08-18)
- [x] Specify max file size and supported formats (Completed 2025-08-19)
- [x] Update wireframes (Completed 2025-08-20)

---

### 5. Mobile Experience

**Question:** How should the calendar adapt for mobile devices?

**Decision:** âœ… **Responsive calendar with mobile-optimized views**

**Key Requirements:**
- Desktop: Month view with full details
- Tablet: Week view with condensed details
- Mobile: List view (agenda) as default, calendar available
- Touch-friendly interactions (tap to view, swipe to navigate)
- Bottom sheet for schedule details on mobile

**Design Impact:**
- FullCalendar supports responsive views
- Custom styling for mobile breakpoints
- Touch gesture support
- Mobile-first alert notifications

**Action Items:**
- [x] Create mobile mockups (Completed 2025-08-19)
- [x] Test on iOS and Android devices (Completed during UAT)

---

### 6. Integration with Resource Management

**Question:** How should maintenance schedules appear on resource detail pages?

**Decision:** âœ… **Dedicated "Maintenance" tab on resource pages**

**Design:**
- New tab alongside "Details", "Activity", "Sharing"
- Shows upcoming maintenance (next 30 days)
- Quick link to view full calendar
- Inline schedule creation
- Recent maintenance log (last 5 entries)

**Action Items:**
- [x] Update resource detail page wireframes (Completed 2025-08-20)
- [x] Design tab navigation (Completed 2025-08-20)
