# Integrate Learning with Reflection

## **What surprised you?**

The experience was genuinely fun and the code generation was impressively easy. I was amazed at how quickly the assistant adapted personas - switching between QA expert and architect roles - and how naturally it diagnosed problems when I played dumb with simple requests like “it doesn’t work, please fix it.”

## **What frustrated you?**

The assistant’s overconfidence was a major pain point. It would confidently deliver solutions that didn’t actually work. I also hit frustrating technical loops where Cline wouldn’t receive terminal callbacks, forcing me to manually report “it’s finished, here’s the error” repeatedly.

## **How would you rate your planning efforts?**

Mixed results. For the API development, my planning was poor - I jumped in with the example prompt, threw away several attempts, then made small tweaks rather than proper planning. However, I improved significantly for the UI phase, though I still leaned on the example prompt text to get started. The lesson is clear: better upfront planning saves time and costs.

## **Did you experience any overwhelm?**

Absolutely. Simple requests like “it’s broken please fix” triggered massive refactoring sessions with overwhelming API calls. The assistant would restructure everything when a small fix was needed.

## **How did you find not hand-writing code?**

Liberating! I committed to giving instructions and playing dumb when things broke. While it was sometimes painful to wait and watch, the wonder of seeing solutions emerge made it worthwhile.

## **How will this experience influence you going forward?**

I’ve already started personal projects using this approach, but with much better planning from the start. The key lesson: invest time in planning for “all-the-things” upfront.
