I have a REST API running at `http://localhost:8000` that I need to consume with my MCP server.

Please create an implementation plan for understanding how this REST API can be exposed as an MCP server:

1. Start the API server by running `./acme-devops-api/api-server`
2. Analyze the API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`
3. Test a few endpoints to understand the request/response format
4. Identify which endpoints would be most useful to expose as MCP tools
5. Design a strategy for wrapping these REST endpoints as MCP tools

Please create a plan and save it as a markdown file in the `docs/exercise 2` folder. Then we can iteratively refine it together.

## Expected Outcome

- Understanding of available REST API endpoints
- Analysis of request/response formats
- Plan for which endpoints to wrap as MCP tools
