  "executive_summary": "The Maintenance Scheduling & Alert System has undergone comprehensive security review. The implementation follows secure coding practices, uses parameterized queries, implements proper authentication/authorization, and includes rate limiting. Two medium-severity findings were identified and accepted as risks with documented justifications. No critical or high-severity vulnerabilities were found. The feature is approved for production deployment.",
