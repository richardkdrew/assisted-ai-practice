- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

The specification has been simplified to focus on the core requirement: implementing a `should_retry(trace_id)` function that analyzes trace data to make retry decisions. This matches the scope defined in the prompt file without unnecessary complexity.

The function has clear requirements that directly align with the prompt:
1. Query trace data for a given trace_id
2. Find error spans
3. Extract error type and error.retriable attributes
4. Return a decision object with all required fields

The specification is ready for planning with a well-defined, focused scope.
