**STATUS**: ‚ö†Ô∏è DRAFT - Not finalized yet (in progress)

## Overview

Community Credits is a system that rewards your contributions to the community with credits that give you priority access when booking resources.

---

## For Community Members

### What are Community Credits?

Community Credits are points you earn by contributing to the community in three ways:
- **Donating items** you no longer need
- **Contributing money** to support the community
- **Volunteering your time** to help with community activities

These credits give you **priority access** when booking popular resources like tools, equipment, and spaces.

### How Credits Are Calculated

| Contribution Type | Formula | Example |
|-------------------|---------|---------|
| Item Donation | Value √∑ 10 | $50 tent = 5 credits |
| Money | Amount √∑ 5 | $50 donation = 10 credits |
| Volunteer Hours | Hours √ó 2 | 3 hours = 6 credits |

### Credit Tiers

Your total credits determine your membership tier:

- ü•â **Bronze** (0-20 credits): Standard member
- ü•à **Silver** (21-50 credits): Priority member
- ü•á **Gold** (51-100 credits): High priority member
- üíé **Platinum** (101+ credits): VIP member

Higher tiers get priority placement in booking waitlists!
