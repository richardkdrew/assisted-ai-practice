# User Story: Maintenance Scheduling & Alert System

## Target Personas

### Primary: Community Administrators
Community administrators are responsible for managing resources across multiple facilities. They need to ensure equipment and spaces are maintained regularly to provide safe, functional resources for their communities.

### Secondary: Maintenance Coordinators
Maintenance coordinators execute maintenance tasks and need clear schedules and deadlines. They need to log completed maintenance and communicate any issues discovered during maintenance.

## User Needs

### As a Community Administrator
"As an admin, I need to schedule recurring maintenance for community resources so that I can ensure equipment remains in good working condition and prevent unexpected breakdowns."

### As a Maintenance Coordinator
"As a maintenance coordinator, I need to see all upcoming maintenance tasks and receive alerts for overdue items so that I can prioritize my work and ensure nothing gets missed."

### As a Resource Manager
"As a resource manager, I need to view maintenance history for each resource so that I can make informed decisions about repair vs. replacement and budget planning."

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
1. ✅ Maintenance schedules can be created with configurable frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually)
2. ✅ Maintenance schedules can be edited and deleted by authorized users
3. ✅ Users receive alerts when maintenance is due or overdue
4. ✅ Maintenance coordinators can log completed maintenance with notes and optional photos
5. ✅ Users can view maintenance history for any resource
6. ✅ Calendar view displays all scheduled and completed maintenance

### Integration Requirements
1. ✅ Integrates with existing Resource Management system (v1.3+)
2. ✅ Uses Notification Service (v2.3+) for email and SMS alerts
3. ✅ Maintains consistent authentication and authorization patterns

### Performance Requirements
1. ✅ Maintenance schedule queries return within 200ms (p95)
2. ✅ Background job processes all due maintenance checks within 2 minutes
3. ✅ System handles 500 concurrent users without degradation

### Security Requirements
1. ✅ Only users with 'admin' or 'maintenance_coordinator' roles can create/edit schedules
2. ✅ Maintenance history is read-only after 30 days (audit trail)
3. ✅ All API endpoints require authentication
4. ✅ Rate limiting prevents alert spam (max 100 alerts/user/day)

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **Maintenance Completion Rate**: 95% of scheduled maintenance logged within 24 hours of due date
- **Alert Effectiveness**: 90% of users acknowledge alerts within 4 hours
- **User Adoption**: 80% of community admins create at least one maintenance schedule within first month

### Secondary Metrics
- **Maintenance Tracking**: Average of 3.5 maintenance schedules per resource
- **Issue Detection**: 15% reduction in emergency repair requests (indicates preventive maintenance working)
- **User Satisfaction**: 4.5/5 average rating in post-feature survey

### Monitoring
- Daily dashboard showing:
  - Number of active maintenance schedules
  - Overdue maintenance items
  - Alert delivery success rate
  - Average time from due date to completion

## Out of Scope (Future Enhancements)
- Maintenance cost tracking and budgeting
- Inventory management for maintenance supplies
- Vendor/contractor management
- Predictive maintenance using ML
- Mobile app for maintenance coordinators
