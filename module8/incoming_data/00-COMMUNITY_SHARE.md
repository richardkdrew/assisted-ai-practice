## 1. Application Context: CommunityShare

### Product Overview

**Product Name:** CommunityShare

**Domain:** Resource management and sharing platform for communities

**Description:** CommunityShare enables communities to manage shared physical resources including tools, equipment, spaces, and facilities. The software facilitates check-in/check-out workflows, maintenance tracking, scheduling, and community membership management.

### Why This Scenario?

- **Domain Separation:** Clearly distinct from software development (no meta-confusion)
- **Universal Relatability:** Everyone understands shared resources
- **Technical Complexity:** IoT integration, scheduling algorithms, real-time updates
- **Multiple Stakeholders:** Members, admins, maintenance staff
- **Rich Feature Variety:** CRUD operations, integrations, background jobs, reporting
- **Clear Success Criteria:** Easy to define what "ready" means for each feature

### Community Types Supported

- Co-housing communities
- Community gardens
- Maker spaces and tool libraries
- Neighborhood associations
- University residences
- Commercial community spaces

### Core Platform Capabilities

- **Resource Check-in/Check-out:** QR code, NFC, or manual tracking
- **Maintenance Management:** Log repairs, routine maintenance
- **Problem Reporting:** Member issue reporting
- **Scheduling & Reservations:** Advance booking system
- **Membership & Identity:** Access permissions tracking
- **Contributions Tracking:** Donated resources and monetary contributions
- **Usage Analytics:** Utilization reports and history

### Resource Types

- Tools & Equipment (power tools, hand tools, gardening equipment)
- Shared Spaces (workshops, garden plots, community rooms, storage)
- Vehicles (bikes, utility vehicles, trailers - future scope)
- Other Community Assets
