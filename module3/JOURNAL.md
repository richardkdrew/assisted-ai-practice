# Learning Journal - Module 3

## Entry 1

- **Prompt**: Read @/prompts/1-web-api-spec.md and follow the instructions at the top of the file.
- **Tool**: Claude Code
- **Reflections**: Still a painfull process when creating the serviuce for th fiurst time. Lets of confidence, missing integration tests and runing off an creating wierd simple_test applications when docker daemon wasnt running. Got it working in the end and once it had a sniff of a problem, was dedidated to fixing, testing and getting ready for the next phase. less need for interation once my assistant underatood therew as an error.

## Entry 2

- **Prompt**: Before we continue, lets revist the context
  files in your memeory. whats missing and
  what could we add now that there is a
  baseline aerhcietctuire na technical
  solutoion in palce? lets disucss before
  adding anything though.
- **Tool**: Claude Code
- **Reflections**: Interestinmg desire to complete the phase :) in discussion thouhg, we got to  a good space with the addition of new memoery files

## Entry 3

- **Prompt**: great. based on the issues we've seen how 
  might we create a spec file like 
  1-web-api-spec.md but specfiically for 
  observability (lets call it 
  3-observabiloty-spec.md) that helps us 
  avoid these when we do this type of work 
  again.
- **Tool**: Claude Code
- **Reflections**: Very long session with some tendency towards wantign to move on before I was ready. Lots of collaborative imporvments and at one point, even a discussion aroudn integration testing and the realissairon that tey hadn't beeen run to test the new observability. Led to a requets to draft upa. a spec in detail and to update WORKFLOW_STATUS to avoid the omissions next time.
