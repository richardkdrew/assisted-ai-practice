# Feature Specification: Structured Error Tracing

**Feature Branch**: `001-structured-error-tracing`
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "structured error tracing"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Capture Errors with Context (Priority: P1)

When an error occurs in the configuration service, developers need to understand not just the error message, but the full context of the request that caused it - including request ID, user context, timestamp, and the sequence of operations that led to the failure.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of error tracing - without capturing structured error information, we cannot effectively debug issues in production or development environments.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering an error condition (e.g., attempting to create an application with invalid data) and verifying that the error log contains structured fields including request ID, timestamp, error type, and context data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a request to create a configuration with invalid data, **When** the validation fails, **Then** the system logs a structured error containing request ID, timestamp, endpoint, error type, and validation details
2. **Given** a database connection failure, **When** attempting to retrieve an application, **Then** the system logs a structured error with request ID, operation attempted, error type, and relevant context data
3. **Given** any unhandled exception, **When** processing a request, **Then** the system captures and logs the full stack trace along with request context in a structured format

### User Story 2 - Trace Errors Across Operations (Priority: P2)

When debugging complex issues that span multiple service operations, developers need to trace the flow of a single request through the system by following a unique request identifier across all log entries.

**Why this priority**: This enables correlation of related errors and operations, which is critical for debugging multi-step workflows and understanding failure cascades.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by making a request that triggers multiple internal operations (e.g., creating a configuration that involves application lookup, validation, and database insert) and verifying all log entries share the same request ID.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a request to create a configuration, **When** the operation involves multiple steps (validation, database queries, etc.), **Then** all log entries for that request contain the same unique request identifier
2. **Given** a request that fails at step 3 of a 5-step process, **When** reviewing logs, **Then** developers can see all successful steps and the failure point using the request ID
3. **Given** concurrent requests from multiple users, **When** errors occur, **Then** each request's error trail is independently traceable via its unique request ID

---

### User Story 3 - Query and Filter Error Logs (Priority: P3)

Operations teams and developers need to query error logs by various criteria - such as error type, time range, specific application ID, or request ID - to identify patterns and diagnose issues efficiently.

**Why this priority**: While capturing and tracing errors is essential, the ability to efficiently query and analyze error patterns significantly improves debugging productivity and incident response.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating various error types over time, then querying the error logs using different filters (by error type, time range, application ID) and verifying correct results are returned.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple errors logged over a 24-hour period, **When** filtering by error type (e.g., "ValidationError"), **Then** only errors of that type are returned
2. **Given** errors related to multiple applications, **When** filtering by application ID, **Then** only errors related to that specific application are returned
3. **Given** errors spanning several days, **When** querying with a time range, **Then** only errors within that range are returned
4. **Given** a specific request ID, **When** querying error logs, **Then** the complete error trace for that request is returned in chronological order

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the error logging system itself fails (e.g., database unavailable for writing logs)?
- How does the system handle extremely large error payloads (e.g., massive stack traces or request bodies)?
- What happens when request IDs are not properly propagated through async operations?
- How are errors handled during system startup before logging infrastructure is fully initialized?
- What happens when circular references exist in error context data being serialized?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST assign a unique request identifier (request ID) to every incoming HTTP request
- **FR-002**: System MUST propagate the request ID through all operations, function calls, and database queries within the request lifecycle
- **FR-003**: System MUST capture errors with structured fields including: request ID, timestamp, error type/class, error message, stack trace, HTTP endpoint, HTTP method, and user/application context
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist error logs with all structured fields for later querying and analysis
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide an API endpoint to query error logs by request ID
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide an API endpoint to query error logs by error type
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide an API endpoint to query error logs by time range (start and end timestamps)
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide an API endpoint to query error logs by application ID
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle logging failures gracefully without blocking the primary request (fail-safe logging)
- **FR-010**: System MUST include validation errors in the structured error format, capturing which fields failed validation and why
- **FR-011**: System MUST include database errors in the structured error format, capturing the operation attempted and relevant context
- **FR-012**: System MUST capture unhandled exceptions and convert them to structured error logs before returning responses to clients
- **FR-013**: Error logs MUST preserve the chronological order of operations within a single request
- **FR-014**: System MUST limit error payload size to 10KB per error log entry to prevent storage issues while maintaining debugging utility; larger payloads must be truncated with indication of truncation

### Key Entities

- **ErrorLog**: Represents a single error occurrence with structured fields:
  - Request ID (unique identifier for tracing)
  - Timestamp (when error occurred)
  - Error type/class (e.g., ValidationError, DatabaseError, AuthenticationError)
  - Error message (human-readable description)
  - Stack trace (technical debugging information)
  - HTTP context (endpoint, method, status code)
  - Application context (application ID if applicable, user context if available)
  - Request payload (sanitized request data for reproduction)
  - Additional metadata (severity level, service version, environment)

- **RequestTrace**: Represents the collection of all logs (errors and operations) associated with a single request ID, enabling full request lifecycle visibility

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developers can trace any error back to its originating request within 30 seconds using the request ID
- **SC-002**: 100% of errors occurring in the system are captured with structured logging (no silent failures)
- **SC-003**: Error logs contain sufficient context that 80% of issues can be diagnosed without requiring additional logging or debugging
- **SC-004**: Query operations on error logs return results within 2 seconds for typical queries (single request ID, error type, or 24-hour time range)
- **SC-005**: Mean time to identify root cause of production errors is reduced by 50% compared to current unstructured logging
- **SC-006**: Error logging does not impact request processing performance by more than 5ms on average
