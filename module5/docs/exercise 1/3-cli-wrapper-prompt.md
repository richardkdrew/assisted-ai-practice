I have a CLI tool at `./acme-devops-cli/devops-cli` that I need to wrap with my MCP server.

Please create an implementation plan that maps CLI commands to MCP tools:

1. Discover what commands this CLI tool supports by running `./acme-devops-cli/devops-cli --help`
2. Test a few commands to understand the output format
3. Design a strategy for wrapping these CLI commands as MCP tools


## Expected Outcome

- Understanding of available CLI commands
- Analysis of input/output formats
- Plan for which commands to wrap as MCP tools
