## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of User Story 1
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of User Stories 1 and 2

### Within Each User Story

- Tests should be written before implementation
- Models before services
- Core functionality before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- Setup tasks can run in parallel
- Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Tests for each user story can be developed in parallel with implementation
- Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch tests and implementation in parallel:
Task: "Create test for FileBasedSpanProcessor in module6/svc/tests/observability/test_file_span_processor.py"
Task: "Create test for trace retrieval in module6/svc/tests/observability/test_span_store.py"

# After foundational components are complete:
Task: "Implement SpanStore class in module6/svc/observability/trace_storage/span_store.py"
Task: "Implement FileBasedSpanProcessor in module6/svc/observability/trace_storage/file_span_processor.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Store and Retrieve Traces)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Demo the ability to store traces and query by trace ID

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational â†’ Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 â†’ Test independently â†’ Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 â†’ Test independently â†’ Demo
4. Add User Story 3 â†’ Test independently â†’ Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Store and Retrieve)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Time and Status Filtering)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Attribute Filtering)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- The feature focuses on adding trace storage and query capabilities to the existing OpenTelemetry setup
- Memory usage must remain under 256MB with maximum spans
- Query performance should be under 100ms for 95% of queries
- This implementation enables developers to analyze traces for debugging without external tools
- Each user story provides distinct value that can be delivered independently
