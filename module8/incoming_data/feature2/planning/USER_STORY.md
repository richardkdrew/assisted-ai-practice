# User Story: QR Code Check-in/out with Mobile App

## Feature ID
FEAT-QR-002

## Target Personas

### Primary: Frequent Tool Users
- Community members who regularly check out tools and equipment
- Workshop organizers who manage multiple resource checkouts
- Makers and craftspeople who need quick access to tools

### Secondary: Resource Administrators
- Staff members who manage resource inventory
- Volunteers who assist with resource management

## User Needs

### As a community member, I want to:
- Quickly scan a QR code to check out a tool without using the web interface
- Complete a checkout in less than 5 seconds
- See real-time availability status of resources
- Check out resources even when network connectivity is poor
- Receive instant confirmation when checkout is complete

### As a workshop organizer, I want to:
- Batch check out multiple tools for a workshop session
- See which tools are available before starting a workshop
- Get notifications when tools become available

## User Journey

### Happy Path: Standard QR Checkout
1. Member walks up to tool cabinet
2. Opens CommunityShare mobile app
3. Taps "Scan QR Code" button
4. Camera opens and member scans QR code on tool cabinet
5. App shows tool details and "Check Out" confirmation
6. Member confirms checkout
7. **Checkout completes in < 5 seconds**
8. Member receives confirmation and can take the tool
9. Other members' apps update in real-time showing tool is no longer available

### Alternative Path: Offline Checkout
1. Member is in area with poor/no connectivity
2. Follows steps 1-6 from happy path
3. App queues the checkout request locally
4. Member receives "Queued for sync" message
5. When connectivity returns, app automatically syncs checkout
6. Member receives delayed confirmation notification

### Check-in Journey
1. Member returns tool to cabinet
2. Opens app and scans same QR code
3. App shows "Check In" confirmation
4. Member confirms check-in
5. Checkout completes instantly
6. All connected clients update showing tool is available

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ QR codes must be unique per resource
- ✅ QR codes must be generated on demand via API
- ✅ Mobile app must request camera permission on first scan
- ✅ Checkout must complete in < 5 seconds under normal conditions
- ✅ Offline mode must queue checkouts for later sync
- ✅ Real-time updates must reach all connected clients within 2 seconds
- ✅ QR codes must expire after 15 minutes for security
- ✅ Invalid/expired QR codes must show clear error messages

### Non-Functional Requirements
- ✅ System must handle 50+ concurrent users without performance degradation
- ✅ Mobile app must work on iOS 14+ and Android 8+
- ✅ QR codes must be readable in various lighting conditions
- ✅ App must gracefully handle network interruptions
- ✅ Security: QR tokens must be cryptographically signed
- ✅ Security: QR codes must invalidate after use

### Success Metrics
- **Target**: 80% of checkouts completed via QR scan within 3 months
- **Target**: Average checkout time < 3 seconds
- **Target**: < 1% failed scans due to QR readability
- **Target**: > 95% user satisfaction with mobile checkout experience
- **Target**: < 0.1% security incidents related to QR spoofing

## Open Questions

- **Risk**: Poor network connectivity in workshop areas
  - **Mitigation**: Offline mode with background sync
- **Risk**: QR code scanning issues in poor lighting
  - **Mitigation**: UI guidance, flashlight control in app
