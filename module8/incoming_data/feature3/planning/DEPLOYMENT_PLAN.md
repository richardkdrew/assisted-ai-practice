## Deployment Architecture

### Feature Flag Strategy

**Flag Name**: `reservation_system_enabled`

**Default State**: `false` (disabled)

**Flag Implementation**:
```javascript
// Backend flag check
if (featureFlags.isEnabled('reservation_system_enabled', { userId, communityId })) {
  // Enable reservation endpoints
}

// Frontend flag check
if (featureFlags.isEnabled('reservation_system_enabled')) {
  // Show reservation UI components
}
```

**Flag Granularity**:
- Can be enabled per community
- Can be enabled per user cohort
- Can be enabled globally

**Rollback**: Simply disable flag (no code deployment needed)

### Database Migration

**Migration File**: `migrations/2025-10-09_reservation_system.sql`

**Tables Created**:
- `reservations`
- `reservation_waitlist`

**Indexes Created**:
- `idx_reservations_conflict` (conflict detection)
- `idx_reservations_user` (user lookup)
- `idx_waitlist_queue` (waitlist ordering)
- `idx_reservations_no_show` (cron job)
- `idx_reservations_calendar` (availability queries)

**Migration Strategy**:
- Run during low-traffic window (2:00 AM - 4:00 AM Pacific)
- Migration is additive (no data modification)
- Estimated duration: 30 seconds
- Zero downtime (new tables don't affect existing features)

**Rollback**:
```sql
-- Rollback script available: migrations/rollback/2025-10-09_reservation_system_rollback.sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS reservation_waitlist;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS reservations;
-- Indexes automatically dropped with tables
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback (Within 5 minutes)

**Trigger Conditions**:
- Critical errors affecting users
- Data corruption detected
- Security vulnerability discovered
- System outage caused by feature

**Procedure**:
1. Disable feature flag: `reservation_system_enabled = false`
2. Verify flag propagation (30 seconds)
3. Confirm error rate drops to baseline
4. Notify stakeholders via #incidents Slack channel
5. Begin root cause analysis

**Impact**: 
- Existing reservations remain in database (no data loss)
- Users cannot create new reservations
- Calendar UI hidden
- No code deployment needed

### Full Rollback (Within 1 hour)

**Trigger Conditions**:
- Issues cannot be resolved by disabling flag
- Database schema issues
- Persistent integration problems

**Procedure**:
1. Disable feature flag (as above)
2. Deploy rollback code (removes reservation endpoints)
3. Run database rollback migration (optional - only if data issues)
4. Verify system stability
5. Post-mortem scheduled within 24 hours

**Impact**:
- All reservation data lost if database rolled back
- Users notified via email of cancellation
- Requires code re-deployment to restore

## Communication Plan

### Internal Communication

- Deployment announcement 48 hours ahead (#engineering)
- Stakeholder briefing (product, support, engineering leads)
- Support team training on new feature

**During Deployment**:
- Real-time updates in #deployments Slack channel
- Status page updates if user-facing changes

**Post-Deployment**:
- Deployment summary (metrics, issues, learnings)
- Daily status updates during Phase 1 & 2
- Weekly summary during Phase 3

### External Communication

**To Communities**:
- **Phase 1 (Pilot)**: Direct email to pilot community managers

- Email guide to all members
- Help documentation published

**Support Materials**:
- FAQ document for support team
- Known issues tracker
- Escalation procedures

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

**1. Datetime Handling (DST Edge Cases)**

**Risk**: 3 integration tests failing for DST transitions
- Spring forward: Booking at invalid times (2:30 AM on spring forward day)
- Fall back: Duration calculation errors during repeated hour
- Conflict detection at DST boundaries

**Impact**: Users in affected timezones may experience booking errors twice per year

**Mitigation**:
- Non-blocking for initial release (rare edge case)
- Warnings shown to users when booking near DST transitions
- Manual testing completed for DST dates in next 6 months
- Fix scheduled for post-launch iteration

**2. Database Performance at Scale**

**Risk**: Conflict detection queries may slow down with high reservation volume

**Impact**: Slow calendar loads, timeout errors

**Mitigation**:
- Performance testing scheduled (post-UAT)
- Indexes optimized for conflict queries
- Database monitoring alerts configured
- Query timeout set to 5 seconds (fail fast)
- Horizontal scaling plan prepared (read replicas)

**3. Waitlist Notification Delivery**

**Risk**: Email service may fail or notifications lost

**Impact**: Users miss opportunities to book from waitlist

**Mitigation**:
- Email delivery monitoring (>98% success rate)
- Retry logic for failed emails (3 attempts)
- In-app notification as backup
- Manual notification process documented for support team

### Medium-Risk Areas

**4. User Confusion (Waitlist UX)**

**Risk**: UAT feedback indicates waitlist feature is confusing

**Impact**: Low adoption, support tickets

**Mitigation**:
- User help documentation updated
- In-app tooltips added
- Onboarding tutorial includes waitlist explanation
- Support team trained on common questions

**5. Documentation Staleness**

**Risk**: User help docs have placeholder sections

**Impact**: Users can't self-serve, increased support load

**Mitigation**:
- Documentation completion prioritized pre-launch
- Known gaps communicated to support team
- Live chat available for questions
- Iterative updates based on user feedback

## Success Criteria (Go-Live Decision)

### Must-Have (Blockers)

- [x] All unit tests passing
- [x] Code review approved
- [x] Security review approved
- [⚠️] Performance testing completed (scheduled, not yet run)
- [⚠️] Stakeholder approval (Product Owner ✅, Community Manager pending)
- [⚠️] User documentation complete (currently has placeholders)

### Nice-to-Have (Non-Blockers)

- [ ] All integration tests passing (3 DST tests failing - acceptable)
- [ ] 100% test coverage (currently 82% - above 80% threshold)
