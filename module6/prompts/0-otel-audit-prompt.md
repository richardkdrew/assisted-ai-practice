# Check OTEL Implementation Status

I need to implement OpenTelemetry tracing for my FastAPI application, but I already have 
a Docker Compose stack running with OTEL Collector, Prometheus, Grafana, and possibly 
other observability tools.

Before I proceed with the implementation described in my requirements document, I need 
you to help me audit my existing setup to avoid conflicts and ensure clean integration.

Please help me:

1. **Check my current OpenTelemetry installation:**
   - What OpenTelemetry packages are already installed in my Python environment?
   - Run: `pip list | grep opentelemetry`
   - Are there any FastAPI instrumentation packages already present?

2. **Examine my environment variables:**
   - Check for any OTEL_* environment variables in my .env file or docker-compose.yml
   - Look for: OTEL_SERVICE_NAME, OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT, OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER, etc.
   - These will override code configuration, so I need to know what's set

3. **Search my codebase for existing OpenTelemetry code:**
   - Scan for imports: `opentelemetry`, `TracerProvider`, `FastAPIInstrumentor`
   - Look for initialization code that might already be setting up tracing
   - Check files: main.py, __init__.py, config.py, or any telemetry/observability modules

4. **Analyze my docker-compose.yml:**
   - What observability services are running? (otel-collector, jaeger, tempo, etc.)
   - What ports are exposed? (4317 for OTLP gRPC, 4318 for OTLP HTTP, etc.)
   - What is the endpoint I should use to send traces to the collector?
   - Are there any environment variables being passed to my FastAPI service?

5. **Check my FastAPI application:**
   - Is FastAPI already instrumented with OpenTelemetry?
   - Are there any existing middleware or decorators handling tracing?
   - Is there any custom span creation already happening?

6. **Based on your findings, tell me:**
   - Can I proceed with a fresh OpenTelemetry installation?
   - Or do I need to extend/modify existing instrumentation?
   - What is the correct OTLP endpoint for my setup?
   - Should I use gRPC or HTTP protocol based on my docker-compose config?
   - Are there any conflicts I need to resolve first?
   - What parts of my requirements document are already satisfied?

Please provide:
- A summary of what's already configured
- Recommendations for integration approach (fresh install vs. extend existing)
- The correct exporter configuration for my Docker stack
- Any potential conflicts or issues I should address
- A checklist of what I need to implement vs. what's already there
