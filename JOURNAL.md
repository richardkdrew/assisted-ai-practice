# Step 1

- Prompt (what we're asking of our assistant): Read @/prompts/1-web-api-specs.md and follow the instructions at the top of the file.
- Tool (our AI assistant): Cline
- Mode (plan, act, etc.): Plan
- Context (clean, from previous, etc.): Clean
- Model (LLM model and version): Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- Input (file added to the prompt): prompts/1-web-api-specs.md
- Output (file that contains the response): prompts/2-web-api-prompt.md
- Cost (total cost of the full run): $0.0064
- Reflections (narrative assessments of the response): My assisstant misunderstood the task. There was no prompt to speak of, stright to a plan for implementing. uwickly fixed when prompted. The resulting prompt looks a bit skinny on details, i.e. the exact tech stack details are missing - already in the context?
