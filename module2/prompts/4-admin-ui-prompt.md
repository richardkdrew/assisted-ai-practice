# Config Service Admin UI Implementation Plan Request

Please create a comprehensive implementation plan for an admin web interface that has features for adding and updating application entries as well as adding and updating the configuration name/value pairs. USe the following critical requriemtns to develop the plan. **STRICT ADHERENCE TO ALL DETAILS IN THIS SPECIFICATION IS MANDATORY.**

## Functionality
Use `@config-service/svc/api/vi/applications.py` and `@config-service/svc/api/vi/configurations.py` to understand which endpoints and payloads are available.

## Core Principles
1. All code should either be TypeScript, HTML, or CSS. Do not use JavaScript directly.
2. Do not take any external dependencies, such as React and Vue, and use the Web Components functionality built into the browser. 
3. Only use the `fetch` feature of modern browsers. The same principle applies to styling - only CSS and the Shadow DOM. 
Create modular, scalable architecture with clear separation of concerns
4. Implement clean, testable code following SOLID principles
5. Focus on dynamic architecture with optimal performance
6. Use design patterns appropriately
7. Follow clean code principles
8. Ensure modular and testable code structure
9. Design for scalability and future growth

## Testing
Automated testing is very important so ensure the plan includes unit testing with vitest and integration testing with Playwright. Also make sure that all flows have end to end tests.

## Developer Experience
Use npm to manage dependencies and run scripts.

Put all ui application code in a `src` folder and all test code in a `tests` folder.
