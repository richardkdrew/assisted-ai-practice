## Notes

The specification for the File-Based Trace Storage and Query feature is complete and ready for planning. The feature aligns with the prompt requirements to create a custom span processor that:
- Stores spans in a file-based storage
- Provides query capabilities by trace ID, time range, and attributes
- Limits storage to a configurable number of spans
- Returns full span information

The specification maintains a technology-agnostic approach while covering all the required functionality. The success criteria align with the checkbox items mentioned in the prompt:
- [x] We can retrieve traces by trace_id
- [x] We can filter traces by time range
- [x] We can query spans by attributes (including error.type)
- [x] Our queries return OpenTelemetry span data in a usable format

The feature is well scoped to focus specifically on the span processor implementation and query functions without expanding into unnecessary areas.
