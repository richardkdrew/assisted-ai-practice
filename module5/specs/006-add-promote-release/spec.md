# Feature Specification: Promote Release Tool for MCP Server

**Feature Branch**: `006-add-promote-release`
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: ✅ READY
**Input**: User description: "I need to implement the most complex tool - `promote-release` which wraps: `./devops-cli promote {app} {version} {from_env} {to_env}`. This tool should: Be named: `promote-release`, Validate that all required parameters are provided, Ensure environments are valid (staging, prod, etc.), Handle the promotion process which might take time, Provide clear success/failure feedback, Include appropriate warnings about production deployments. Please create a detailed implementation plan for this tool with extra care for validation and error handling."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: How should the MCP server validate application names? → A: Let the CLI handle it - MCP only validates non-empty string, CLI returns error if app doesn't exist
- Q: What version format validation should the MCP server enforce? → A: Any non-empty string - Accept any version string; CLI validates if version exists in source environment
- Q: What environment promotion paths should be allowed? → A: Strict forward flow - Only allow dev→staging, staging→uat, uat→prod (no skipping, no backward)
- Q: What timeout should be set for promotion operations? → A: 5 minutes (300 seconds) - Standard for most deployment operations
- Q: How should production deployment warnings be handled? → A: Enhanced logging - Log warning with full audit trail but proceed automatically (no blocking)
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What happens if a promotion is already in progress for the same app/environment combination? Should we block, queue, or fail?]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the tool support rollback if promotion fails partway through?]

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Feature requests MCP tool wrapping `devops-cli promote` command
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: MCP API consumers, DevOps CLI, deployment infrastructure
   � Actions: promote releases, validate parameters, warn about risks, provide feedback
   � Data: app name, version, source environment, target environment
   � Constraints: comprehensive validation, long-running operation handling, production safety
3. Identify clarification needs:
   � Valid app names (dynamic vs. hardcoded?)
   � Version format requirements (semver vs. free-form?)
   � Environment promotion rules (allowed paths?)
   � Timeout handling (how long to wait?)
   � Production warnings (blocking vs. informational?)
   � Concurrency handling (same app/env conflicts?)
   � Rollback support (failure recovery?)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � User promotes dev�staging � validates parameters, executes promotion, reports success
   � User promotes staging�prod � shows production warning, validates, executes, reports status
   � User provides invalid parameters � immediate validation error, no CLI call
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement testable against promotion behavior
6. Identify Key Entities
   � PromotionRequest (all parameters for promotion)
   � EnvironmentPromotionRule (allowed promotion paths)
   � PromotionResult (success/failure feedback with details)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � Critical ambiguities marked for clarification
8. Return: PENDING CLARIFICATION (7 questions outstanding)
```

## =� Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a DevOps engineer or release manager, I need to promote application releases between environments through the MCP interface, so that I can safely move validated versions through the deployment pipeline with proper validation and production safeguards.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Valid Promotion - Non-Production
1. **Given** I call promote-release with app="web-api", version="1.2.3", from_env="dev", to_env="staging", **When** the MCP server validates and executes the promotion, **Then** the devops-cli promote command is invoked with correct parameters and success status is returned
2. **Given** I call promote-release with valid parameters for staging�uat promotion, **When** the promotion completes successfully, **Then** I receive a success response with confirmation details (app, version, environments)
3. **Given** a promotion operation takes 45 seconds to complete, **When** I wait for the result, **Then** the MCP server waits for completion and returns the final status (no premature timeout)

#### Valid Promotion - Production (with Warnings)
1. **Given** I call promote-release with to_env="prod", **When** the MCP server processes the request, **Then** an enhanced warning with full audit trail is logged to stderr and the promotion proceeds automatically
2. **Given** I promote to production successfully, **When** the operation completes, **Then** the success response includes production deployment confirmation details
3. **Given** I promote to production and it fails, **When** the operation fails, **Then** the error response clearly indicates production deployment failure with detailed error message

#### Parameter Validation - Required Fields
1. **Given** I call promote-release without app parameter, **When** the MCP server validates inputs, **Then** validation fails immediately with error "app parameter is required"
2. **Given** I call promote-release without version parameter, **When** the MCP server validates inputs, **Then** validation fails immediately with error "version parameter is required"
3. **Given** I call promote-release without from_env parameter, **When** the MCP server validates inputs, **Then** validation fails immediately with error "from_env parameter is required"
4. **Given** I call promote-release without to_env parameter, **When** the MCP server validates inputs, **Then** validation fails immediately with error "to_env parameter is required"

#### Parameter Validation - Environment Rules
1. **Given** I call promote-release with from_env="invalid", **When** the MCP server validates environments, **Then** validation fails with error listing valid environments
2. **Given** I call promote-release with to_env="invalid", **When** the MCP server validates environments, **Then** validation fails with error listing valid environments
3. **Given** I call promote-release with from_env="prod" and to_env="dev", **When** the MCP server validates promotion path, **Then** validation fails with error "backward promotion not allowed: prod→dev"
3a. **Given** I call promote-release with from_env="dev" and to_env="uat", **When** the MCP server validates promotion path, **Then** validation fails with error "invalid promotion path: dev→uat (must be dev→staging)"
3b. **Given** I call promote-release with from_env="staging" and to_env="prod", **When** the MCP server validates promotion path, **Then** validation fails with error "invalid promotion path: staging→prod (must be staging→uat)"
4. **Given** I call promote-release with from_env=to_env (same environment), **When** the MCP server validates parameters, **Then** validation fails with error "cannot promote to same environment"

#### Parameter Validation - Application & Version
1. **Given** I call promote-release with app="nonexistent-app", **When** the MCP server validates the app and executes the CLI, **Then** the CLI returns an error indicating the app doesn't exist
2. **Given** I call promote-release with version="nonexistent-version", **When** the MCP server validates the version and executes the CLI, **Then** the CLI returns an error indicating the version doesn't exist in the source environment
3. **Given** I call promote-release with empty string for app, **When** the MCP server validates inputs, **Then** validation fails with error "app cannot be empty"
4. **Given** I call promote-release with whitespace-only version, **When** the MCP server validates inputs, **Then** validation fails with error "version cannot be empty"

#### Error Handling - CLI Execution Failures
1. **Given** the devops-cli promote command fails with non-zero exit code, **When** the MCP server processes the result, **Then** an error response is returned with the CLI error message
2. **Given** the devops-cli command exceeds 300 seconds (5 minutes), **When** the timeout is reached, **Then** the CLI process is terminated and a timeout error is returned
3. **Given** the devops-cli is not available/installed, **When** the MCP server attempts to execute it, **Then** a clear error is returned indicating the CLI is not available

#### Concurrency & State Management
1. **Given** a promotion is in progress for app="web-api" from dev to staging, **When** another request attempts to promote the same app from the same source, **Then** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should the second request fail, queue, or be allowed?]
2. **Given** simultaneous promotions for different apps, **When** both execute, **Then** both should complete independently without interference

### Edge Cases
- What happens if from_env and to_env are the same? � Validation should fail with clear error
- What happens if version doesn't exist in from_env? � CLI will fail; MCP returns CLI error details
- What happens if promotion fails halfway through? � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: rollback support needed?]
- What happens with very long-running promotions (>5 minutes)? � Timeout after 300 seconds; CLI process terminated and timeout error returned
- What happens if CLI output is malformed/unexpected? � Parse failure should be caught and returned as MCP error
- What happens with special characters in app/version names? � Should be validated/sanitized for shell safety

## Key Entities *(mandatory)*

### 1. Promotion Request
**Description**: A complete set of parameters required to promote a release between environments

**Attributes**:
- app: Application name (non-empty string, sanitized)
- version: Version identifier (any non-empty string; existence validated by CLI)
- from_env: Source environment (valid environment name, normalized)
- to_env: Target environment (valid environment name, normalized)

**Validation Rules**:
- All four attributes are required (cannot be None/null)
- All strings must be non-empty after trimming
- from_env and to_env must be valid environments (dev, staging, uat, prod)
- from_env must not equal to_env
- Promotion path from_env�to_env must be allowed (rules TBD)
- All values must be sanitized for shell safety

**Lifecycle**:
1. Received from MCP API consumer
2. Whitespace trimmed on all string fields
3. Validated (all rules applied)
4. Normalized (environments to lowercase)
5. Passed to CLI subprocess
6. Result captured and returned to consumer

### 2. Environment Promotion Rule
**Description**: Constraints defining valid promotion paths between environments

**Attributes**:
- allowed_paths: Strict forward flow only: dev→staging, staging→uat, uat→prod
- production_target: Boolean indicating if to_env is production
- requires_confirmation: False (production promotions log enhanced warnings but proceed automatically)

**Behavior**:
- Applied after environment name validation
- Blocks invalid promotion paths before CLI execution
- Triggers production warnings when applicable
- Stateless evaluation (no side effects)

### 3. Promotion Result
**Description**: Structured outcome of a promotion operation (success or failure)

**Attributes**:
- success: Boolean indicating outcome
- app: Application that was promoted
- version: Version that was promoted
- from_env: Source environment
- to_env: Target environment
- cli_output: Output from devops-cli command
- error_message: Human-readable error (if failed)
- execution_time: Duration of CLI command

**Usage**:
- Returned to MCP API consumer as MCP response
- Logged to stderr for audit trail
- Includes production deployment flag if applicable

### 4. Production Deployment Warning
**Description**: Special notification for production promotions

**Attributes**:
- message: Warning text about production risk
- target_env: Always "prod"
- requires_confirmation: False (enhanced logging only, non-blocking)

**Behavior**:
- Displayed when to_env is "prod"
- Logged to stderr before execution with full audit trail (app, version, from_env, timestamp)
- Does not block execution (proceeds automatically after logging)

## Out of Scope *(optional)*

The following are explicitly NOT part of this feature:

1. **Automated rollback on failure** - Manual rollback procedures remain unchanged; no automatic rollback implementation
2. **Approval workflows** - No multi-user approval process; assumes caller has appropriate permissions
3. **Deployment scheduling** - Promotions execute immediately; no delayed/scheduled deployment support
4. **Multi-region deployments** - Single region promotion only; multi-region coordination out of scope
5. **Deployment history tracking** - No persistent storage of promotion history in MCP server
6. **Dry-run mode** - No simulation/preview mode; promotions execute immediately upon validation
7. **Partial promotions** - All-or-nothing promotion; no support for gradual rollout percentages

## Success Metrics *(optional)*

### User Experience
- **Validation feedback time**: <10ms for parameter validation errors
- **Production warning clarity**: 100% of production promotions show clear warning before execution
- **Error message actionability**: Users can identify and correct errors without external support

### Reliability
- **Promotion success rate**: Track CLI execution success vs. failure rates
- **Timeout occurrence**: Monitor frequency of promotion timeouts to tune timeout value
- **Parameter validation accuracy**: Zero false positives/negatives in validation

### Security
- **Injection attack prevention**: 100% of shell injection attempts blocked at validation layer
- **Production deployment audit**: 100% of production promotions logged with full context

### Performance
- **Validation overhead**: <10ms parameter validation time
- **CLI execution time**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: baseline for typical promotion duration?]
- **Concurrent promotion handling**: No performance degradation with multiple simultaneous promotions

## Dependencies & Constraints *(optional)*

### Dependencies
- **Feature 005**: Environment validation layer (reuse validate_environment function)
- **devops-cli**: External CLI tool must be installed and available in PATH
- **Subprocess infrastructure**: Python subprocess module with timeout support
- **Logging infrastructure**: stderr logging for audit trail

### Constraints
- **Constitutional Principle I (Simplicity)**: Promotion logic must be clear and minimal
- **Constitutional Principle II (Explicit Error Handling)**: All failure modes must have explicit error messages
- **Constitutional Principle III (Type Safety)**: All functions must have complete type hints
- **Constitutional Principle IV (Human-in-the-Loop)**: Production warnings must involve human awareness through enhanced audit logging (informational, non-blocking)
- **Constitutional Principle VI (MCP Protocol Compliance)**: All output to stdout must be MCP-compliant; diagnostics to stderr
- **Security**: All parameters must be sanitized; no shell injection vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Long-running CLI operations must not block other MCP requests
