# Integrating learning experience with reflection

Before the next time we meet, please post a link to your repo and your reflections to Discord.


1. How smooth was the process of getting your first tool working in the MCP Inspector?


2. How did you find the difference between building and using a stdio server versus the http one?


3. How successful was your assistant at knowing when and how to use the tools?


4. Not suggesting the world needs more MCP servers :) but have you identified one that might be good to build for yourself or your org?
